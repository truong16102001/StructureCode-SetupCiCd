# Applying Migrations in EF Core

## Create Migrations
	1. Windows command prompt: "Add-Migration MigrationName [options]"
	2. dotnet CLI: "dotnet ef migrations add MigrationName [options]"
	=>> EX-PMC(package manager console): "Add-Migration InitialMigration"
	=>> EX-CLI(command line): "dotnet ef migrations add InitialMigration --output-dir Your/Directory"

## Applying Created Migration
	1. Windows command prompt: "Update-Database [options]"
	2. dotnet CLI: "dotnet ef database update [options]"
	=>> EX-PMC: "Update-Database"

## Removing a Migration
	1. Windows command prompt: "Remove-Migration [options]"
	2. dotnet CLI: "dotnet ef migrations remove [options]"
	=>> EX-PMC: "Remove-Migration"
## Want to use RawQuery with EF to handle sort on multi columns with flexible sort strategy
	=> Break up Clean Architecture Rule (Application have to reference to Persistence layer)

# Strategy for Execution Strategy
## SQL-SERVER-STRATEGY-1
	- Use ApplicationDbContext for entire source code => Handler global Transaction
		Advantage:
			Can use pair with retry execution strategy
		Downside:
			Break up Clean Architecture Rule (Application have to reference to Persistence layer)
## SQL-SERVER-STRATEGY-2
	- Use UnitOfWork for entire source code => Handler global Transaction
		Advantage:
			Keep up Clean Architecture Rule (Application does not reference to Persistence layer)
		Downside:
			Can not use pair with retry execution strategy
## Avoid error check for format 'using( .. ) { ... }' => Comment '# csharp_prefer_simple_using_statement = true:error' on .editorconfig file

## Noted:
	Trong class 'TransactionPipelineBehavior' Mình chỉ handler Transaction cho Command thôi vì Query chỉ Get data nên các command phải theo rule có name ending 'Command' =>> Mình đã set rule này trong ArchitectureTest rồi
